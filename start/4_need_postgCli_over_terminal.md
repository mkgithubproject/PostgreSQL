Nice catch 👌 — this is a very common confusion.
Let’s clear it up step by step:

---

### 1. Terminal vs CLI tools

* **Terminal (macOS Terminal app)** → Just a **window to interact with your shell** (bash/zsh). It doesn’t know anything about databases.
* **CLI tools (PostgreSQL command-line utilities)** → These are **programs** that let you actually talk to PostgreSQL.

Examples:

* `psql` → interactive shell for PostgreSQL (like MySQL’s `mysql` client).
* `createdb`, `dropdb` → create or drop databases.
* `pg_dump`, `pg_restore` → backup/restore databases.
* `pg_ctl` → control PostgreSQL server (start/stop).

---

### 2. Why you need PostgreSQL CLI tools

Without them, your terminal can only run general commands (`ls`, `cd`, etc.), but it **cannot run SQL commands** like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

👉 You need `psql` (a CLI tool) to connect to PostgreSQL and send SQL queries.

---

### 3. Analogy

* **Terminal** = just the steering wheel of your car.
* **CLI tools** = actual controls like accelerator, brake, gear shift.
  Without the right controls, the steering wheel alone won’t drive the car.

---

### 4. Why not only pgAdmin (GUI)?

* **pgAdmin** is a GUI for PostgreSQL. It’s easier for beginners.
* But CLI tools are:

  * Faster for quick queries
  * Needed for automation (scripts, DevOps, migrations)
  * Preferred by backend developers

Most professionals use both:

* **pgAdmin** for visual stuff (view tables, schema).
* **psql/CLI tools** for fast queries and scripting.

---

✅ **In short**:

* macOS Terminal = blank workspace.
* PostgreSQL CLI tools = actual programs that let you interact with the PostgreSQL server from that workspace.

---

Yes ✅ absolutely — in fact, that’s the **most common way developers connect to PostgreSQL**.

But here’s the important detail:

* The **macOS Terminal app** itself can’t talk to PostgreSQL.
* You need the **PostgreSQL CLI tool** called **`psql`** (which gets installed when you install PostgreSQL with Postgres.app, Homebrew, or the installer).

---

### 🔹 Steps to connect PostgreSQL from Terminal

1. **Check if `psql` is installed**
   Run:

```bash
psql --version
```

If you see something like:

```
psql (PostgreSQL) 16.3
```

then you’re good ✅.

---

2. **Connect to PostgreSQL server**
   By default, Postgres creates a user matching your macOS username.
   Run:

```bash
psql postgres
```

This connects you to the **default database** called `postgres`.

You’ll see something like:

```
psql (16.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

Now you’re inside PostgreSQL! 🎉

---

3. **Run SQL commands**
   Inside `psql`, you can run queries like:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
\c testdb        -- connect to testdb
CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Mohit');
SELECT * FROM users;
```

---

4. **Exit psql**
   Type:

```sql
\q
```

---

✅ So yes — you use **Terminal** to launch **`psql`** → then you’re connected to PostgreSQL and can run SQL commands directly.

---

Good question 👍 Let’s break the two cases clearly:

---

### 1. **Opening Terminal and typing `psql`**

* You’re still in **macOS Terminal (zsh/bash)**.
* When you type `psql`, you’re launching the **PostgreSQL CLI tool** *inside* the terminal.
* So the terminal becomes a **Postgres SQL shell**.
* Prompt changes from something like:

  ```
  mohit@MacBook-Air ~ %
  ```

  to

  ```
  postgres=#
  ```
* Now you can only type SQL commands or `psql` meta-commands (`\c`, `\d`, etc.).

---

### 2. **Opening the `psql` CLI tool directly (if it’s in your apps or PATH)**

* There isn’t a separate “standalone app” window for `psql`.
* It’s always a **command-line program** that runs inside a terminal.
* So whether you “open psql directly” or “type `psql` in Terminal” → it’s the *same thing*.

---

### 3. **Think of it like this**

* **Terminal** = general-purpose workspace (can run any command).
* **psql** = one specific program that runs *inside* the terminal to talk to PostgreSQL.

So:

* You **need terminal** (or another shell) to run `psql`.
* Opening “psql tool” = just typing `psql` inside that terminal.

---

✅ In short:

* `psql` is **not** a separate graphical program — it’s a **CLI program**.
* You always run it from a terminal (just like `git`, `node`, or `python`).

---

Ahh 👍 I get where the confusion is coming from — let’s clear it up step by step:

---

## 1. You already have **Terminal** on macOS

* That’s just a **window** to run any CLI program (zsh/bash).
* Out of the box, it can only run **basic commands** (like `ls`, `cd`, `echo`).

---

## 2. When you install Git

* You don’t get a *new terminal app* (on macOS).
* You just get a **new CLI program** called `git`.
* That program is placed in a folder like `/usr/local/bin` (or `/opt/homebrew/bin`) which is already in your `$PATH`.
* So now, inside your same macOS Terminal, you can type:

  ```bash
  git init
  git status
  git commit
  ```

  because the `git` command is now available.

---

## 3. Why sometimes you hear about "Git Bash"

* On **Windows**, there’s no built-in Unix-like terminal.
* So when you install Git for Windows, it ships with **Git Bash** (a mini-terminal that looks like Linux).
* That’s why people say "Git gives you a terminal" — but that’s only true for Windows.

On **macOS/Linux**, you already have a Unix-like terminal, so Git just installs the `git` **command-line tool**, not a whole terminal.

---

## 4. Same logic with PostgreSQL

* macOS Terminal is always there.
* When you install PostgreSQL, you get the **`psql` tool**.
* It’s not a new terminal — it’s a **program you run inside the existing terminal** (just like `git`).

---

✅ **In short:**

* **Terminal** = the door 🚪
* **Git, psql, node, python, etc.** = the tools you bring inside that door to actually do work.

---

Exactly ✅ You nailed it. Let’s break it down:

---

### 1. Why Windows needs a separate Git CLI

* Windows **does not come with a Unix-like shell** (bash/zsh) by default.
* Its built-in terminal (`cmd.exe` or PowerShell) works differently and doesn’t understand typical Linux/Unix commands (`ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, etc.).
* But Git was originally built for Linux/Unix, so it expects that kind of shell.

👉 To fix this, **Git for Windows** comes bundled with:

* **Git Bash** → a mini terminal that provides a Linux-like environment on Windows.
* Inside Git Bash, you can run both **Git commands** and **Unix-style commands** (`ls`, `grep`, `ssh`, etc.).

---

### 2. On macOS / Linux

* You already have a Unix-like shell (zsh/bash).
* So when you install Git, it doesn’t need to install an extra terminal.
* It just drops the `git` command into your system’s `$PATH`, and you run it from the existing terminal.

---

### 3. Analogy

* **macOS/Linux**: You already have a toolbox (Terminal). Installing Git just adds a new wrench (`git`).
* **Windows**: You don’t even have a proper toolbox for Git. So Git brings its **own toolbox (Git Bash)** along with the wrench.

---

✅ **In short**

* Windows → needs Git Bash (separate Git CLI) because its default terminal isn’t Unix-like.
* macOS/Linux → already Unix-like, so Git just works inside the normal Terminal.

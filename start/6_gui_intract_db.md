Great question 👍 You’re looking for a **GUI client for PostgreSQL on Mac**, similar to **MongoDB Compass**.

Here are the most popular (and beginner-friendly) options:

---

## 🔹 1. **pgAdmin 4** (official GUI)

* Official PostgreSQL GUI.
* Free and open-source.
* Lets you manage databases, write queries, and monitor performance.
* Works like Compass for MongoDB.

👉 Install on Mac with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask pgadmin4
```

Then open it from **Applications** → login → connect to your local `localhost:5432` or cloud DB.

---

## 🔹 2. **TablePlus** (Mac-friendly, modern UI)

* Clean, fast, and native Mac app.
* Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, etc.
* Very similar experience to Compass.

👉 Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask tableplus
```

---

## 🔹 3. **DBeaver** (multi-database, powerful)

* Free & open-source.
* Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc.
* More enterprise-level features.

👉 Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask dbeaver-community
```

---

## 🔹 4. **Postico** (Mac-only, lightweight)

* Simple UI for PostgreSQL.
* Beginner-friendly, but paid (with limited free trial).

👉 Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask postico
```

---

# ✅ Recommendation

* If you want the **official Compass-like tool** → use **pgAdmin 4**.
* If you want a **fast, modern Mac experience** → use **TablePlus** (my top pick).

👉 Do you want me to show you how to **connect your local PostgreSQL (installed via Homebrew) to pgAdmin/TablePlus step by step**?

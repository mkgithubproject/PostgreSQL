Great thinking ðŸ¤” â€” but hereâ€™s the key: **your system does NOT download all the packages**.

---

### 1. What actually gets stored

When you run:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

your system only downloads the **package metadata/index**, not the actual `.deb` packages.

* Metadata = package names, versions, dependencies, descriptions.
* Itâ€™s like downloading a **catalog of books**, not the books themselves.
* This catalog is just a few **hundred MB at most**, not GBs.

---

### 2. When are real packages downloaded?

Only when you install something:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql
```

Then apt fetches:

* `postgresql-x.y.z.deb` (the actual installer file)
* Any required dependency `.deb` files

These `.deb` files are stored temporarily in:

```
/var/cache/apt/archives/
```

You can clear them anytime with:

```bash
sudo apt clean
```

---

### 3. Why it doesnâ€™t take huge memory

* Even though there are **millions of packages available worldwide**, your system only keeps a **small index file**.
* Actual packages are fetched **on demand**.

---

### 4. Analogy ðŸ“š

* Imagine an **online bookstore**:

  * You donâ€™t download every book.
  * You just have the **catalog**.
  * When you order a book, it gets delivered (downloaded).

Thatâ€™s exactly how **apt repos** work.

---

âœ… So no worries â€” your system will **not fill up with millions of packages**. It only pulls what you actually install.

Would you like me to show you **how to check the exact size** of the apt package index files on your system?

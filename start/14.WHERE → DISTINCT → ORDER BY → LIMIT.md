Perfect! Let’s go step by step and cover **data refining in PostgreSQL** using **WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, LIMIT, and LIKE** with clear examples. These are core SQL clauses for filtering, sorting, and refining results.

---

# **1. WHERE – Filtering Rows**

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on conditions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO products (name, category, price) VALUES
('Laptop', 'Electronics', 800),
('Mouse', 'Electronics', 20),
('Chair', 'Furniture', 100),
('Desk', 'Furniture', 200);

-- Get all Electronics
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

-- Get products with price > 100
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 100;
```

---

# **2. ORDER BY – Sorting Results**

Sort query results by one or more columns.

```sql
-- Ascending order (default)
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price;

-- Descending order
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Multiple columns
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY category ASC, price DESC;
```

---

# **3. DISTINCT – Unique Values**

Remove duplicate rows from results.

```sql
-- Unique categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM products;

-- Unique combination of category + price
SELECT DISTINCT category, price FROM products;
```

---

# **4. LIMIT – Restrict Number of Rows**

Return only a subset of results.

```sql
-- Top 2 expensive products
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

---

# **5. LIKE – Pattern Matching**

Filter rows using patterns.

* `%` → any number of characters
* `_` → exactly one character

```sql
-- Names starting with 'L'
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE 'L%';

-- Names ending with 'e'
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%e';

-- Names containing 'es'
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%es%';

-- Names with exactly 5 letters
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '_____';
```

---

# **6. Combining Clauses**

You can combine `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`, `LIKE` together:

```sql
-- Top 2 unique categories of products with price > 50, sorted descending
SELECT DISTINCT category 
FROM products
WHERE price > 50
ORDER BY category DESC
LIMIT 2;

-- Products starting with 'D', price <= 200
SELECT * 
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE 'D%' AND price <= 200
ORDER BY price ASC;
```

✅ **Summary of Data Refining Clauses**

| Clause     | Purpose                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| `WHERE`    | Filter rows based on conditions   |
| `ORDER BY` | Sort results ascending/descending |
| `DISTINCT` | Remove duplicate rows             |
| `LIMIT`    | Restrict number of rows returned  |
| `LIKE`     | Pattern matching with `%` and `_` |

If you want, I can create a **visual flow diagram** showing **how PostgreSQL processes these clauses step by step** (WHERE → DISTINCT → ORDER BY → LIMIT) — it really helps to understand the execution order.

Do you want me to do that?

Perfect 👍 Let’s go hands-on with **examples for `COUNT` in PostgreSQL**.

---

## 🟢 Example Table: `Employees`

```
id | name    | department | salary
---+---------+------------+-------
1  | Alice   | HR         | 5000
2  | Bob     | IT         | NULL
3  | Charlie | IT         | 6000
4  | David   | Finance    | 7000
5  | Emma    | HR         | NULL
```

---

## 🔹 1. `COUNT(*)`

Counts **all rows**, no matter if columns have `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
```

✅ Output:

```
count
------
5
```

👉 Because there are 5 rows total.

---

## 🔹 2. `COUNT(column)`

Counts only rows where that column is **NOT NULL**.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM Employees;
```

✅ Output:

```
count
------
3
```

👉 Only Alice (5000), Charlie (6000), David (7000) have non-NULL salaries.

---

## 🔹 3. `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`

Counts unique non-NULL values.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) FROM Employees;
```

✅ Output:

```
count
------
3
```

👉 Departments are: HR, IT, Finance → 3 unique.

---

## 🔹 4. `COUNT` with `WHERE`

Counts rows matching a condition.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

✅ Output:

```
count
------
2
```

👉 Bob and Charlie are in IT.

---

## 🔹 5. `COUNT` with `GROUP BY`

Counts per group.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department;
```

✅ Output:

```
department | total_employees
-----------+-----------------
HR         | 2
IT         | 2
Finance    | 1
```

---

⚡ Quick summary:

* `COUNT(*)` → counts all rows.
* `COUNT(col)` → counts non-NULL values of that column.
* `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` → counts unique non-NULL values.
* `COUNT` + `WHERE` → filters before counting.
* `COUNT` + `GROUP BY` → counts per category.

Do you want me to also show how `COUNT` works in your **Visits/Transactions example** side by side with input/output like this?

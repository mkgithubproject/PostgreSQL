Perfect! Let’s do a **complete guide on SQL JOINs in PostgreSQL** with **types, examples, input tables, and output**.

---

# **1. Understanding JOINs**

JOINs are used to **combine rows from two or more tables** based on a related column.

We’ll use two example tables:

### Table: `employees`

| emp\_id | emp\_name | dept\_id |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1       | Alice     | 1        |
| 2       | Bob       | 2        |
| 3       | Charlie   | 1        |
| 4       | David     | 3        |

### Table: `departments`

| dept\_id | dept\_name |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1        | HR         |
| 2        | Finance    |
| 3        | IT         |
| 4        | Marketing  |

---

# **2. INNER JOIN**

* Returns rows **only when there’s a match in both tables**.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Output:**

| emp\_name | dept\_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Alice     | HR         |
| Charlie   | HR         |
| Bob       | Finance    |
| David     | IT         |

✅ Only employees with a matching `dept_id` in departments are returned.

---

# **3. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**

* Returns **all rows from the left table**, even if there’s no match in the right table.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Output:**

| emp\_name | dept\_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Alice     | HR         |
| Charlie   | HR         |
| Bob       | Finance    |
| David     | IT         |

* If there were employees with **dept\_id not in departments**, their `dept_name` would be `NULL`.

---

# **4. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**

* Returns **all rows from the right table**, even if no match in the left table.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Output:**

| emp\_name | dept\_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Alice     | HR         |
| Charlie   | HR         |
| Bob       | Finance    |
| David     | IT         |
| NULL      | Marketing  |

* Department "Marketing" has no employee → `emp_name` = NULL.

---

# **5. FULL OUTER JOIN**

* Returns **all rows from both tables**, unmatched rows have `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Output:**

| emp\_name | dept\_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Alice     | HR         |
| Charlie   | HR         |
| Bob       | Finance    |
| David     | IT         |
| NULL      | Marketing  |

✅ Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOIN behavior.

---

# **6. CROSS JOIN**

* Returns **all combinations of rows** from both tables (Cartesian product).

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
```

**Output (12 rows: 4 employees × 3 departments)**

| emp\_name | dept\_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Alice     | HR         |
| Alice     | Finance    |
| Alice     | IT         |
| Bob       | HR         |
| Bob       | Finance    |
| Bob       | IT         |
| Charlie   | HR         |
| Charlie   | Finance    |
| Charlie   | IT         |
| David     | HR         |
| David     | Finance    |
| David     | IT         |

---

# **7. SELF JOIN**

* A table joined with itself, often with aliases.

```sql
SELECT e1.emp_name AS employee, e2.emp_name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2
ON e1.dept_id = e2.dept_id AND e1.emp_id <> e2.emp_id;
```

**Output:** (pairs of employees in same department)

| employee | manager |
| -------- | ------- |
| Alice    | Charlie |
| Charlie  | Alice   |
| Bob      | NULL    |
| David    | NULL    |

---

# **8. NATURAL JOIN**

* Automatically joins tables using columns **with the same name**.

```sql
SELECT emp_name, dept_name
FROM employees
NATURAL JOIN departments;
```

* Equivalent to `INNER JOIN ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id`

---

# **9. Summary Table of Joins**

| Join Type       | What it returns                   | Example                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| INNER JOIN      | Only matching rows                | Alice & HR                  |
| LEFT JOIN       | All left rows + matches           | Employees + dept            |
| RIGHT JOIN      | All right rows + matches          | Departments + employees     |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | All rows from both tables         | Employees + all departments |
| CROSS JOIN      | All combinations                  | 4 × 3 = 12 rows             |
| SELF JOIN       | Table joined to itself            | Employee pairs              |
| NATURAL JOIN    | Matches on columns with same name | Auto inner join on dept\_id |

If you want, I can **draw a visual diagram showing all joins with input and output tables**, so it’s super easy to remember and visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

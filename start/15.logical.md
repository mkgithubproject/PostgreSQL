Ah! Now we are talking about **Relational Operators** and **Logical Operators** in PostgreSQL (used in `WHERE` clauses for filtering). Let’s break it down clearly with examples.

---

# **1. Relational Operators**

These operators **compare two values** and return `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.

| Operator      | Meaning                          | Example                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `=`           | Equal to                         | `WHERE age = 25`              |
| `!=` or `<>`  | Not equal                        | `WHERE age <> 25`             |
| `<`           | Less than                        | `WHERE price < 100`           |
| `>`           | Greater than                     | `WHERE price > 50`            |
| `<=`          | Less than or equal               | `WHERE age <= 30`             |
| `>=`          | Greater than or equal            | `WHERE salary >= 20000`       |
| `BETWEEN`     | Within a range (inclusive)       | `WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30` |
| `IN`          | Matches one of the listed values | `WHERE dept_id IN (1,2,3)`    |
| `IS NULL`     | Check for NULL                   | `WHERE email IS NULL`         |
| `IS NOT NULL` | Check not NULL                   | `WHERE email IS NOT NULL`     |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE age >= 25 AND dept_id IN (1, 2)
  AND email IS NOT NULL;
```

# **2. Logical Operators**

These operators **combine multiple conditions**.

| Operator | Meaning                        | Example                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `AND`    | Both conditions must be TRUE   | `WHERE age > 25 AND salary > 30000` |
| `OR`     | At least one condition is TRUE | `WHERE age < 25 OR salary > 50000`  |
| `NOT`    | Negates a condition            | `WHERE NOT (dept_id = 1)`           |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE dept_id = 1 AND (salary > 30000 OR age < 25);
```

---

# **3. Combining Relational and Logical Operators**

You can combine both types to make **complex filters**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE (category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Furniture')
  AND price BETWEEN 50 AND 500
  AND name IS NOT NULL;
```

* Relational operators: `=`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NOT NULL`
* Logical operators: `OR`, `AND`

---

✅ **Tip to remember:**

* **Relational operators** → Compare values (`=`, `<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`)
* **Logical operators** → Combine conditions (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)

---

If you want, I can make a **visual table showing all relational + logical operators with priority order**, so you’ll know which operators PostgreSQL evaluates first in queries.

Do you want me to do that?
